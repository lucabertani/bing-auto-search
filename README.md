## 🔧 Technical Details

### Manifest V3

The extension uses Manifest V3, the latest version of the Chrome/Edge extension system.

### Required Permissions

- **storage**: To save user configurations
- **tabs**: To open and close search tabs
- **scripting**: To fill and submit search forms
- **alarms**: To persist timeouts across service worker sleep cycles

### Service Worker (background.js)

- Manages the search cycle
- Automatically generates 200 unique queries
- Controls timeouts for opening/closing tabs
- Uses Chrome Alarms API for delays >30 seconds
- Handles safe cycle interruption

### Query Generation

Queries are automatically generated by combining:

- Common question templates ("what's the weather", "how to", etc.)
- Subjects and contexts ("today", "in Italy", "in Rome", etc.)
- Various topics (fruit, technology, travel, animals, etc.)
- Actions (buy, cook, install, etc.)

Examples of generated queries:

- "what's the weather today?"
- "how to cook pasta?"
- "where to buy computer?"
- "how much is phone?"
- "what's the best restaurant?"

## 🎨 Interface

The popup features:

- Modern minimalist design
- Clean and compact layout
- Microsoft-inspired color scheme
- Real-time status feedback
- Input validation

## ⚙️ Default Configuration

- **X** (close tab): 10-20 seconds
- **Y** (wait): 50-80 seconds
- **Z** (total searches): 10

## 🛡️ Security

- No sensitive data is collected
- Configurations are saved locally in the browser
- The extension only accesses bing.com
- All code is transparent and verifiable

## 📝 Notes

- Searches are opened in background tabs to not disturb browsing
- The cycle can be interrupted at any time
- Configurations are saved automatically
- The extension stops automatically upon completing the set number of searches
- For delays >30 seconds, the extension uses Chrome Alarms API to survive service worker sleep
